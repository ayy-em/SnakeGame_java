# SnakeGame_java

A simple snake game written using Java 8.
Really, though, it's a sample exercise i thought of to try and get a quick gripe on array functionality. The game features:
1. Incremental score increase
2. Images loaded from files in /resources/ folder
3. New game / Game Over / Length tracking

Code is easily available for everyone willing to learn a bit of Java

Enjoy!
